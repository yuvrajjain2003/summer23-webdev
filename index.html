    This is the main branch for the repository. DO NOT MODIFY THIS BRANCH.
    According to standard GitHub industry practices, you can only make changes to the
    develop branch, and not the main branch for safety and privacy reasons.
    We will follow the same convention while making this project to develop
    good habits along the way.

    If you have somehow found you way to this text, checkout the latest version of develop,
    and make your changes there. If you want, you can also create a branch at that point.
